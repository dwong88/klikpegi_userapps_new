  "readme": "# cordova-plugin-keyboard\n\n> This plugin provides the `Keyboard` object which has some functions to customize and control the keyboard. It also supports the __HideKeyboardFormAccessoryBar__ (boolean) and __KeyboardShrinksView__ (boolean) preferences in config.xml.\n\nThis plugin has only been tested in Cordova 3.2 or greater, and its use in previous Cordova versions is not recommended (potential conflict with keyboard customization code present in the core in previous Cordova versions). \n\nIf you do use this plugin in an older Cordova version (again, not recommended), you have to make sure the HideKeyboardFormAccessoryBar and KeyboardShrinksView preference values are *always* false, and only use the API functions to turn things on/off.\n\nThis plugin was based on this Apache [project](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugins/tree/master/keyboard) and has a compatible API.\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Methods](#methods)\n    - [Keyboard.shrinkView](#keyboardshrinkview)\n    - [Keyboard.hideFormAccessoryBar](#keyboardhideformaccessorybar)\n    - [Keyboard.disableScrollingInShrinkView](#keyboarddisablescrollinginshrinkview)\n    - [Keyboard.hide](#keyboardhide)\n    - [Keyboard.show](#keyboardshow)\n- [Properties](#properties)\n    - [Keyboard.isVisible](#keyboardisvisible)\n    - [Keyboard.automaticScrollToTopOnHiding](#keyboardautomaticscrolltotoponhiding)\n- [Events](#events)\n    - [keyboardDidShow](#keyboarddidshow)\n    - [keyboardDidHide](#keyboarddidhide)\n    - [keyboardWillShow](#keyboardwillshow)\n    - [keyboardWillHide](#keyboardwillhide)\n    - [keyboardHeightWillChange](#keyboardheightwillchange)\n- [Releases](#releases) \n\n# Installation\n\nFrom [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-keyboard) (stable)\n\n`cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-keyboard`\n\nFrom github latest (may not be stable)\n\n`cordova plugin add https://github.com/cjpearson/cordova-plugin-keyboard`\n\n# Methods\n\n## Keyboard.shrinkView\n\nShrink the WebView when the keyboard comes up.\n\n    Keyboard.shrinkView(value, successCallback);\n\n#### Description\n\nSet to true to shrink the WebView when the keyboard comes up. The WebView shrinks instead of the viewport shrinking and the page scrollable. This applies to apps that position their elements relative to the bottom of the WebView. This is the default behaviour on Android, and makes a lot of sense when building apps as opposed to webpages.\n\n\n#### Supported Platforms\n\n- iOS\n\n#### Quick Example\n\n    Keyboard.shrinkView(true);\n    Keyboard.shrinkView(false);\n    Keyboard.shrinkView(null, function (currentValue) { console.log(currentValue); });\n\n## Keyboard.hideFormAccessoryBar\n\nHide the keyboard toolbar.\n\n    Keyboard.hideFormAccessoryBar(value, successCallback);\n\n#### Description\n\nSet to true to hide the additional toolbar that is on top of the keyboard.

});\n\n## Keyboard.disableScrollingInShrinkView\n\nDisable scrolling when the the WebView is shrunk.\n\n    Keyboard.disableScrollingInShrinkView(value, successCallback);\n\n#### Description\n\nSet to true to disable scrolling when the WebView is shrunk.\n\n\n#### Supported Platforms\n\n- iOS\n\n#### Quick Example\n\n    Keyboard.disableScrollingInShrinkView(true);\n    Keyboard.disableScrollingInShrinkView(false);\n    Keyboard.disableScrollingInShrinkView(null, function (currentValue) { console.log(currentValue);
